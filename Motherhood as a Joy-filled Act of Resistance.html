									<h1>Motherhood as a Joy-filled Act of Resistance...</h1>

									I sit in a room full of mothers. We are showering a new mom, welcoming her into “the club”. I sit in a room full of mothers, talking about their weeks, their days, their children, themselves. They discuss how they adjusted to being a first-time mom, how their pregnancy, birth, and recovery went. The mistakes they made. The joys and the sorrows in those early months. I	listen. I don’t add to the conversation. I sit, I listen and I smile. I don’t smile because it’s the polite thing to do. I smile because these women are a part of resistance and more than likely do not even realize it. Motherhood is the most joy filled, action packed, intensely stressful, most beautiful role and privilege in the universe. I am convinced of it. I cannot think of anything that brings me more turmoil, more peace, more joy, more sorrow, more hopes, more dreams, more inspiration, and more motivation, than being a mother.

									The popular culture of today devalues motherhood. Not only do we perpetuate the message that motherhood is “just” motherhood and a woman should have many other things going for herself than “just” being a mother. We also make women feel that at some point she MUST become a mother to fulfill her ultimate destiny. The 	mixed messages have left women confused and feeling quite put down as whole. I want to specifically address the message that tells women that motherhood sucks, it	should be put off for as long as possible, and if you are a mother then you must also have a business or a job. Why can’t motherhood be someone’s lifelong 	aspiration. I mean honestly, what higher of an aspiration can there be than to bring an entire living soul into the world and/or raise a soul in this world and prepare that soul for the next life? In my worldview, there is no higher calling.

								<div align="justify"><p>
									Every day, mundane, simple, tasks have both intrinsic and extrinsic value; Cooking, cleaning, wiping snotty noses and butts, teaching a child to read, doing 	laundry, putting things away, creating a peaceful space for the family to spiritually heal in, are ALL very valuable tasks. In many ways, I’d argue some of the most valuable things you can do with your time are right there in your own home with your own children.
								</p></div>

								<center>
									<div class="image fit"><img src="images/Motherhood as a Joy/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								</center>

								<div align="justify"><p>
									So, I watch these women share and encourage one another. I watch them pick up the milk cups, the random toys, the shoes. I listen as they laugh and enjoy this 	moment of not merely knowing they are in “the club” but truly experiencing “the club”.
								</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
									If you are a mother, you have resisted. You have resisted everyone and everything telling you that you would never become enough if you became a mother and 	dedicated your time to someone else. You resisted the temptation to live a life that is completely about you. You have resisted the dominant culture trying to 	convince women that we would be much happier if we abandoned motherhood. You are a The Joy filled Resistance.
