									<h1>A White Women's Guide to Conversing About Race With Black Americans</h1>

									For the sake of brevity, I have to use a broad brush in this guide. This list is a broad generalization and the first step in self-checking before having a conversation with anyone who identifies as a Black American. This guide was born from having hundreds of conversations with white Americans from different backgrounds and feeling that I was having the same conversation over and over. There were things that I would hear as problematic and would want to correct and advise on, but for the sake of connection, refrained from doing so. However, I do see that there is a need for this guide. I hope that this guide does not cause offense but that it is seen as an offering. Something that says “hey I want to have these conversations but I also need for you to follow a few rules and be aware of a few basic things.”

							 <div align="justify"><p>
							 	<ul>
									<li>Educate yourself on the collective Black American feelings on the matter
    						  <li>Ask yourself if you understand what you’re reading or hearing
    						  <li>Try to empathize
    							<li>Decide if the goal is being right or being connected
    							<li>Look for nuance and sit with that nuance
    							<li>Listen to what that individual is saying and validate what they are saying
    							<li>Understand that your agreement with how that individual feels is not the end goal and may not be one of the goals of the individual at all
    							<li>Be prepared to hear something hurtful and try to believe that the intention is not to hurt but it is to voice pain or call attention to a pain that is there
    							<li>Understand that if you went through what Black Americans live through daily you would be upset and not in the best of moods most of the time
								 </ul>
								</p></div>

						 <center><h3>Mindfully consider these..</h3></center>

							<div align="justify"><p>
								<ul>
									<li>Don’t assume your view of the world is a given or “common sense”
    							<li>Recognize that on virtually every matter the Black American relationship to said topic and experience with the said topic will be different
    							<li>Don’t be defensive
    							<li>Don’t center the entire discussion on yourself, your desires, what you think, what you want, how you feel someone else should feel, etc. Step outside of yourself
    							<li>Don’t use words like “ignorant, aggressive, angry, intimidating, n-word, etc.” These terms are terms that will immediately inflate the conversation to levels you will not be prepared for. Find another  way to express your thoughts or just hold these types of thoughts in
    							<li>Don’t hold Black Americans to a standard that you would not hold a white counterpart in the same situation. If you would find an excuse for your white son, daughter, nephew, or sibling, use that same energy to find an excuse for this Black individual
    							<li>Don’t be afraid to voice your opinion strongly. We generally respect someone who stands their ground where valid and necessary but can apologize or back off something offensive or wrong
    							<li>Don’t under any circumstance mention your proximity to a black person as a qualifier to your point. We generally don’t care if you’ve dated/married someone black, have a black best friend, have a black child, or work with black people. None of this means that you understand us or that you aren’t bias in regards to us
								</ul>
							</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
									I hope that this guide serves as a starting point. There’s no amount of literature you can read and no amount of work you can ever do to ever understand what we go through. We know that. We are not asking for you to metaphysically go back in time and make your ancestors endure trauma that they pass down to you and then for you to live the lives we live. We are asking you to attempt to heal and then in that healing to meet us with empathy and respect. This guide, I hope, will be of service to many on their healing journeys. We are all healing from something. Having racist ideas, whether by choice or by virtue of being born and raised in a white society built on racism, does not make you a bad person. It just means you have blind spots that need some attention and an adjustment made.
