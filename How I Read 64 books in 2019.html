									<h1>How I Read 64 books in 2019 and  <br>
									Why You Shouldn’t Strive for That Number...</h1>
								</header>


								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/How I Read/1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
									I posted on my Instagram account last week that I’d read 62 (<b>now 64</b>) books in the past Gregorian calendar year (2019). A few people commented and directly messaged me asking how on earth	I had managed to read that many books. I personally didn’t feel that 62 was necessarily a lot of books but I also didn’t feel it was only a few. At the beginning of 2019 I decided that I would count how many books I’d finished by the end of the year. I had no goal, no aspiration, no judgment on what was many or few. I simply wanted to be informed about how many books I give myself the gift of reading. My philosophy of reading is akin to the thoughts and feelings of two great thinkers of time past; George R.R. Martin and Descartes.

								<H2>“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies...The man who never reads lives only one.”<H2>

									<code><b>–George R.R. Martin</b></code>

									<div class="image fit"><center><img src="images/How I Read/2.jpg" alt="" /></center></div>

									<H2>“The reading of all good books is like conversation with the finest (people) of the past centuries.”</H2>

									<code><b>–Descartes.</b></code><br/>

								<div align="justify"><p>
									When I read, I immerse myself in the story. I think about how I would feel as the protagonist (if there is one). I think about how the author felt as they penned whatever I’m reading (usually when I’m reading nonfiction). In one year, I feel I’ve learned things about the world and about myself as if I traveled and lived a few different lives, simply by reading more than a few books!

									<H2>So, how did I do it?</H2>

								<ol>
									<li>Found the genres I was most interested in and went to town.</li>
									<li>Utilized the library</li>
									<li>Bought from used bookstores</li>
									<li>Stayed up late at night</li>
									<li>Opened a book instead of binge-watching a TV program</li>
									<li>Didn’t pressure myself to finish books I knew I wouldn’t come around to enjoy</li>
									<li>Book swapping with friends all over (mail can get pricey so keep it local if you are trying to save the coin)</li>
								</ol>

								<div class="image fit"><center><img src="images/How I Read/4.jpg" alt="" /></center></div>


								<div align="justify"><p>
									I think the most meaningful concept I took from this year’s read count, is that one should read for pleasure and enjoyment as much as possible. And, if you aren’t enjoying what you’re reading, then stop reading that book and find a different one. Our souls are always ready and willing to be fed and nourished. Reading a such a pure way to do just that.
									In 2020 I hope whomever is reading this post, finds novels that nourish your truest self. I hope you read books that help you to become the beautiful, God created, immortal you were designed to be.
