									“It is often assumed that the chief reason for making things—furniture, clothing, toys, a garden—is to save money. There are other factors that may be of equal or greater importance: making what we need for life is a way of expressing creativity and of gaining greater confidence. Emotional security comes from providing the necessities of life in personal, meaningful ways, by our own hands or those of friends and loved ones. Another value in studying how things are made is to increase our appreciation for them as we better understand what makes them work. The knowledge that comes from shaping the things around us helps us build relationships with the world that are more intimate.”

								I began making beautiful things with my hands as an adult, in college. I’d finished my basketball and school career in late December and just began full time work. Work I truly enjoyed but work that was long and extremely emotionally draining. I cared for 6 infants, ranging in age from 6 weeks-12 months old every day for 12 hours a day. It was rewarding to be caring for the needs of the children of others. I got to see them grow and develop and I’m incredibly thankful for those years. During that time, I had the realization that I didn’t feel I was skilled enough with my hands. I felt I should be able to cook, paint, sew, fix things, make things. I began to work on my hand based skillset.
								</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
								The one art that stuck was learning to crochet. I am self-taught in the art after learning the basic foundations through my college roommate. I have never had formal training but with a combination of Pinterest and YouTube, I’m able to learn new stitches and slowly understand the community language.
								</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
								I’ve had the joy of handcrafting hats, blankets, scarves, headbands, necklaces, and many other things for friends, family and customers. I’ve poured love, blessings and prayers over items made; knowing that the item would be what was keeping a child warm and comforted on many nights.
								</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
								In the fight against consumerism I’ve noticed that not buying anything simply doesn’t work. It will last maybe 48 hours for a while and then I’m back at target buying something I don’t need but think I especially want. I’ve found that what works is learning about the value of handmade/homemade/handcrafted items. Value, being something that is more than just quantitatively valued. I found that the true value is in the story or the journey that the maker took with the product. When I’m crocheting a blanket, for example, that yarn is being twisted, knotted, wrapped and stitch through whatever emotions and events are occurring in my life. I pour prayers over those rows and stitches. I think a lot about the individual I’m making that blanket for. I try to pay special attention to anything that may be irritating to the person who will use the item. If I’m making a baby blanket I try to buy yarn that I know from experience is tried and true with sensitive skin. If I’m making a body butter for someone who I know has skin that doesn’t love coconut oil, I adjust the recipe specifically for that individual. Sometimes I instinctually remember a comment the individual made that would lend itself to add less lavender essential oil so as not to overpower the senses. These may seem to be small things but personally when I’m spending these things are huge game changers.
								</p></div>

								<div align="justify"><p>
								I want to come up against consumerism and as a by-product against capitalism. I want to make things that I feel I need or want before I buy. I want to have a home that has items that have stories. Items that have been crafted with love and care. I want to support makers directly. I don’t want huge corporations to get away with supplying the masses with cheaply made products that ruin quickly and force you to buy more. I want to support value. So, this year as you are buying gifts for those you love, considering investing in value. Sure, it may mean smaller and less gifts but it also means gifts with more meaning and value. A trade off I’m certainly happy to make.
